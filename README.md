## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

There was a problem at my work where we had problemas adding new phonenumbers on our mobile phone, which we just needed to add in order to chat with whatsapp web.
This app si made in order to give it a number, and automatically open a chat with that phone number in the desktop app

## Optimizations

The design was just a parody to a workmate actual webpage, so the design could be improved.
Also the UX is not that good as it open anothre tab that you have to click in to use it, but it wasnt just that neccesary

## Lessons Learned:

It teached me how to use some basic JS in order to solve day to day problemas that i face.
